	 *    completed. If it has not completed, then result == DS_RESULT_PENDING.
	 * 3) result == DS_RESULT_SUCCESS implies state == in_transition.
	 * 4) If result is not DS_RESULT_SUCCESS nor DS_RESULT_PENDING, the
	 *    in_transition records the blob's lifetime stage that could not been
	 *    reached because of the error in result.
	 * 5) state and in_transition are strictly monotonically increasing
	 *    according to DS_BLOB_WORKER_STATE: NEW, CREATED, ((PUT or COPIED), COMMITTED) or
	 *    (COMMITTED, GET) or GET. DELETED may occur at any time after create.
	 *
	 * With GET, state and in_transition are immediately set to GET, as the
	 * state of the blob in the worker does not change. result is set to
	 * DS_RESULT_PENDING, and changed to DS_RESULT_SUCCESS once the file is
	 * retrieved.
